## Brief Synopsis of Research

Alessia Visconti is an expert in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, and her research activity deals with the development and application of statistical and computational methods to identify multi*-omics* modifications influencing complex human phenotypes. 
She has also worked on the problem of knowledge discovery in biological data, developing new approaches tailored to solve biological tasks, and on the reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks. 

A more detailed description of Alessia's research activity and of her research projects can be found on her [CV]({{ "/" | relative_url }}assets/CV-Visconti.pdf), while a list of her publications can be found [here]({{ "/" | relative_url }}publications/). She is also an active software developer, and the list of scientific software she has contributed to is available [here]({{ "/" | relative_url }}software/).
