## Scientific Software


- **AID-ISA** extracts biologically relevant biclusters from microarray gene expression data by leveraging additional knowledge. It is described [here](http://compbio.di.unito.it/tools/AID-ISA/index.html).

- **CDoT** is a novel exact algorithm for answering Maximum a Posteriori queries on tree-structured Probabilistic Graphical Models.

- **famCNV (v2.0)** enables genome-wide association of copy number variants with quantitative phenotypes in families. It can be download from [here](http://www.twinsuk.ac.uk/project/famcnv/).

- **GOClust** performs a coclustering of microarray gene expression data by means of Gene Ontology-derived constraints.  It is described [here](http://compbio.di.unito.it/tools/GOClust/index.html).

- **MotifsLinker** associates clusters of proteins with their frequent motifs. It is available [here](http://compbio.di.unito.it/tools/recomb/motifslinker.html).

- **PopPAnTe** enables pairwise association testing in related samples. It can be downloaded from [here](http://www.twinsuk.ac.uk/project/poppante/).

- **RGO** (Restructured Gene Ontology) is a reorganisation of the Gene Ontology that emphasises regulative information so to provide better structure for gene functional analysis. It can be downloaded from [here](http://compbio.di.unito.it/tools/RGO/index.html).

- **SPOT** performs an exhaustive search of frequent motifs in sets of biological sequences. It is available [here](http://compbio.di.unito.it/tools/spot/spot.html).
