- **AID-ISA** extracts biologically relevant biclusters from microarray gene expression data by leveraging additional knowledge. It is available [here](https://github.com/alesssia/AID-ISA).

- **CDoT** is a novel exact algorithm for answering Maximum a Posteriori queries on tree-structured Probabilistic Graphical Models (&#9840;). 

- **famCNV (v2.0)** enables genome-wide association of copy number variants with quantitative phenotypes in families. It is available [here](https://twinsuk.ac.uk/resources-for-researchers/software/).

- **GOClust** performs a coclustering of microarray gene expression data by means of Gene Ontology-derived constraints (&#9840;).  <!-- It is described [here](http://compbio.di.unito.it/tools/GOClust/index.html). -->

- **MAP** is a proof-of-concept not production-ready pipeline for the analysis of metagenomic data. It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/alesssia/MAP).

- **MotifsLinker** associates clusters of proteins with their frequent motifs (&#9840;). <!-- It is available [here](http://compbio.di.unito.it/tools/recomb/motifslinker.html). -->

- **PopPAnTe** enables pairwise association testing in related samples. It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/alesssia/poppante).

- **RGO** (Restructured Gene Ontology) is a reorganisation of the Gene Ontology that emphasises regulative information so to provide better structure for gene functional analysis (&#9840;). <!-- It can be downloaded from [here](http://compbio.di.unito.it/tools/RGO/index.html). -->

- **SPOT** performs an exhaustive search of frequent motifs in sets of biological sequences (&#9840;). <!-- It is available [here](http://compbio.di.unito.it/tools/spot/spot.html). -->

- **YAMP** is a containerised and reproducible pipeline which allows processing raw metagenomic sequencing data up to the functional annotation. It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/alesssia/YAMP).
