	\stlist{2019 -- 2023}{\textbf{Instructor} for several programming and data analysis workshops:\\
		& \hskip1cm - The Unix Shell\\
		& \hskip1cm - Version Control and collaboration with Git/GitHub\\
		& \hskip1cm - Python Programming\\
		& \hskip1cm - R Programming\\
		& \hskip1cm - Introduction to Working with Data\\
		& \hskip1cm - OpenRefine\\
		& These workshops are designed for PhD students and early career researchers but are open to researchers at every level, including PIs, are offered regularly (roughly twice a year), and have always been evaluated as ``excellent'' or ``exceptional'' by the attendees (details on some of the workshops can be found at \url{https://kcl-carpentries.github.io/}). \\
		& The workshops are centred around the idea of ``live coding'', where attendees code along with the instructors thus getting useful hands-on experience and improving their ability to explore the topics on their own.\\
